Collection of my advent of code 2021 programs, originally had all of these on repl.it but it was a hassle to use so I moved them here instead :)


## Tech Stack

Typescript, Node


## Installation

Just need to be able to run typescript programs.

```bash
npm install -g ts-node typescript '@types/node'
```

Some days might have extra packages, just run
```bash
npm install
```
in their folder if they do.
    
## Usage/Examples

```shell
cd Day-16-Packet-Decoder
ts-node index.ts
```
